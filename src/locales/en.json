  "FAQ": {
    "question-1": "Can ChatPDF speak my language?",
    "answer-1": "Yes, ChatPDF can read PDFs and answer questions in any language. You can upload a PDF in one language and ask questions in another. The greeting message will be in the PDF’s language. After that, ChatPDF will answer in the language you ask. If a message isn’t in the language you want, just ask ChatPDF to change it.",
    "question-2": "Is ChatPDF free?",
    "answer-2": "ChatPDF allows you to use it for free with 2 PDFs every day, each up to 120 pages. For more, you can upgrade to ChatPDF Plus.",
    "question-3": "Can I chat with multiple PDF files at the same time?",
    "answer-3": "You can! Create a folder and drag multiple PDFs into it. Then, click on the folder to chat with all PDFs at once. Creating a folder only works on a desktop computer, not from a phone.",
    "question-4": "Are my files secure?",
    "answer-4": "ChatPDF will never share your files with anyone. They are stored on a secure cloud storage and can be deleted at any time.",
    "question-5": "How do I delete a PDF from ChatPDF?",
    "answer-5": "From Chat view: click gray Delete Chat button on the top right. From the Home page: click the X next to the chat title in the My Chats section. This will permanently delete the chat and PDF file content from ChatPDF servers.",
    "question-6": "How does ChatPDF work?",
    "answer-6": "In the analyzing step, ChatPDF creates a semantic index over all paragraphs of the PDF. When answering a question, ChatPDF finds the most relevant paragraphs from the PDF and uses the ChatGPT API from OpenAI to generate an answer."
